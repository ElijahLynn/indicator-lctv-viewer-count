Running and installing
======================

To run the applet, simply launch indicator-lstv-viewer-count.py: ./indicator-lstv-viewer-count.py.

You can also install it globably on your system using the provided install
script. The command to launch is then "lstv" (without the .py).

If you like it, I would suggest adding it to the startup applications of your desktop
environment.
